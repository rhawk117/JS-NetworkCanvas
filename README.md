# JS-NetworkCanvas

Uses Vanilla JS & JQuery to render a background a graph of connected nodes that periodically shows Dijkstra's algorithm by randomly selecting 2 points on the graph.  

One of the first major projects I ever created, should of used the Canvas API and element over divs for better performance on re-renders but it was a lot of fun to develop and really cool.
